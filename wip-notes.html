I want to create a new definition of what it is to be organized, involving AI tools, track all the open loops, write a book (like Getting Things Done) about this hashtag idea: #organization . Hashtag marketing. #marketing

Never lose an idea again.

Track all things that have gotcha deadlines. And enforce them.

Highlight key moments in conversations. Or zones and have AI grab the good quotes. track app names and links that are new. (optional add to graph)

Track problems. Mentioned across conversations.

How to run a good organization

How to run an AI-powered organization #idea

Tag things with hashtags in your text messages so it gets remembered.

#BookIdea

Frictionless super memory

Voice record passively while doing meditation.

Thoughtstream while driving, et cetera.

queue @ targets

To aggregate meaningful stuff.

It's not just a tool but a system. Maybe it's the system I can sell at this point or plant the flag for because tools are going to be commodities. But innovation and ideas are still advancements. Maybe even patentable.

Set up automatic follow-ups on your friends.

Have your little bot tell people your status. If you're busy and that you care about them or that you're not going to make it



Write a book on OpenClaw. #BookIdea



 how to use a graph database as a second brain.

 create the living compendium of this, a living book.



 doing it in non-split pane text editors like Google Docs and Multiple Windows . using comments



 back on the previous topic, search and add  for individual book and collective book both, like having those as one thing for collective, especially having bots to see if the questions have been asked before with auto reply



automatically structuring knowledge into your knowledge base

 these are all the workflow updates you need



 searching, finding all your poems, and making a website  as an actual user story or activity



this could be a whole workbook where people try different things and they build their whole life out



 also building a digital life building a minimalist home page

How to get AI to flesh out your ideas







 Digital transformation, AI transformation



 we could go into organizations and help transform them. #BusinessModel





host openclaw config-a-thon #idea @mikeng

how to apply ai







 Track relational connections





 host what you tried and what didn't work; increasingly important with AI

 looking for contradictions. Something to do with the graph integration finding coherence ?  looking for similar ideas Looking for relevant people within your organization

 making issue trackers and contributing to them in the world

 this is the Manifesto for a Movement that you can contribute to, not just a personal organization book

here is how to be a good digital citizen  humanity 3.0 to be part of humanity 3.0to be part of Humanity 3.0 #title  make the global mind more coherent with us. how to become a digital superhuman and contribute to the global mind



 add and notice insights to global mind

 never about the software, about the movement



use claude collective intelligence? w antivirus or trusted group global curation is antivirus . provably no attack vectors? @chlipala

what lists to curate





 bathroom codes







what networks to join or be featured on renaissance.engineer   adjacent

what twitters to follow?  for different things



 write books on how to achieve goals. Don't get stuck on software. The software is to achieve the goals





 curate your inner sanctum  separate kind of curation, both your own stuff and then also sources of good stuff

 refreshing your context window

 write a section on the ways AI informs us

 the universe is animate. We prompt it; that's all of our actions. What we are doing is prompting people, management as prompt

definition of bullshit  stuff getting in the way of clear response to prompting AI is very; it provides a very pure laboratory to understand what should be working .



 daily alternative way to implement second brains with just files, lists, files, and then daily notes right to it redundantly because you can do that with AI de-normalized



gestalts #makingvisible

 there are invisible things that are there but just we can't see or touch. We're making these possible to see #line





 getting things remembered





 recommend Open Markdown Reader at the very least for watching live code flow out

 a separately AI Forward software development guide  have APIs for things; have CLIs  have all the settings in state intelligible by the AI Assistant . and Founder guide planning for the AI Revolution. Serialize things out to Markdown files in real time so they can be watched or to some other output stream . alternatively they can serialize stuff out to a shared graph database protocol in the cloud open output protocol

<span class="section-break">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span>



 AI and relationships

have your bot. Check in sweetly  and express care even when you cannot



 having the AI as a focus buddy. Having presence with you



 having the AI, a digital twin, pretend to be someone with a certain life rhythm, like a good influence person

have it generate a story like Diamond Age, with you as a transforming protagonist AI for transformation

 it's not just about AI; it's about how to life I can track my life rhythm in the specific exercises I do  and if you get these things right, how little else needs to go right

 not actually that hard to do what I'm doing

also people can log their transformation journeys. I want paths of graceful transformation that you'd actually want  to recommend others to walk that could go or are related to curiosity threads



 have a tool to assign people homework; have a tool to assign the world homework  sbs

 give a real cohort of people daily challenges #idea



like vibe coding session about what to do



tpp all over again . actual interactive loop of cohort



transform your workflow seminars w our tool



for writers etc . writers also teach contemplation and qigong etc multi step horse stance many days get deep . curriculum cohort transforms over time



how to go voice



capture complaints for things #curate



 ask AI to stream and consolidate. Ask AI to group stuff up   for instance that should go under the kind of thing to curate  and that should be adjacent to the at target use case like  @lawyer

<span class="section-break">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span>

 how to not life  anti-patterns if you notice yourself doing X

 Energy leaks.



Whatshouldido.com could be around contributing to the global movement. Hey if you don't have anything better to do, work on this global movement. Act as a sensor here for the super organism

 or who needs you? What missions could you do

 you can post "Someone needs help with X" and it could even be in your network, like Facebook friend based

ideate

meditate

learn something

metagallery of learning options

 clean your room but you could reply, "I don't feel like it." you can chat about it

 or what should I eat?  are you actually hungry ,  If so X or Y.

 everyone has an implicit life quest tracker. We are just making it visible #makingvisible

well did you get an exercise today?  it could track this issue on your #lifedashboard



Food

Sleep

Exercise

Physical environment

Social environment

Miniature U tracker

U-Neo-pet

Be empty. Let things come to you but you can say it out loud with a voice assistant here.  #voice



#voice  also use it as a Pilates teacher



Activities you could do: all the cool activities you could do, like kid activities website and #lms learn naulis on my backlog #learn

#curate #learn  things to learn



 another AI practice is to just get used to dropping tags in the middle of all kinds of stuff: emails, Slack, notes, because it's going to get filtered and appear immediately there



externalizing your cognition #title how to project your mind into digital space



 principle: capture things immediately don't try to find file

 there should always be a more meta scratch pad of where you are maybe. It can be at the top and hit back or it could just be a side bar, which is implicitly present when you say voice. Hey Siri, make a note or something or whatever because it creates that in your screen. There could always be a quick capture drop down as well .the stream is also implicitly always there. This just makes it visible



 write about how to deploy humans and how to deploy agents to return information



 keep a personal dashboard. with all your links and active projects it's above and beyond the file system



 Health Dashboard Tracker for yourself and the world



 how to talk with people, resolving conflicts, NVC, how to community house

 you've got to actually get good at NVC  lame if misapplied



 what does the review process look like with AI



 write in your stream and tell AI to send it to Slack without opening Slack  #best #usecase



 track patterns that seem to happen, patterns of high productivity. Like stuff just all seems to get in order or it goes in late at night and everything is clear. Right now I'm adding my Applied Tao S to my website.  what induces these patterns? What creates it? Is this something I should be curating

#writing #workflow  just dictate it into Claude code and have it do it eg this
