# The Context Engineering Prize

*December 29, 2025*

## The Idea

What if a small model like Claude Haiku could perform at frontier model levels - not through more parameters, but through better prompting?

The hypothesis: Models like Haiku could match frontier performance if prompted with:
- Meta-skills (self-reflection, self-understanding)
- Domain skills with usage instructions
- Structured reasoning patterns

## The Prize

**Create a "Context Engineering Prize"** - a competition to get small or old models to perform at frontier levels on standard benchmarks.

### Why This Matters

All the current work goes into building bigger models. But there's untapped alpha in **context engineering** - the art of prompting models to perform beyond their apparent capabilities.

### The Benchmark

Score = (Performance on standard benchmark) / (Model size or compute cost)

Competitors would submit:
- The model used (must be publicly available, small/old)
- The system prompt / context
- The benchmark results

### Analogy

It's like being at MIT surrounded by people with "bigger parameters" - but compensating with better self-control, metacognition, and knowing how to use your capabilities effectively.

## Status

Idea stage. Looking for collaborators interested in defining the benchmark and prize structure.
